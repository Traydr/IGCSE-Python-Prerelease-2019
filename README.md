# IGCSE-Python-Prerelease-2019
This is my original work, for when I was taking the exam. It does not represent how I currently name variables or structure my coding. It was fun for me to look back and see how far i've progressed in the 2 years since this code was last accessed.

Anyway this is the prerelease for the 2nd time zone (if im not mistaked) for the Cambridge International Education (CIE) exam board.
Might update it slightly to make my organisation focused brain calmed down.

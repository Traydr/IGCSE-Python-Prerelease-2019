# IGCSE-Python-Prerelease-2019
This was my implementation of the CIE (Cambridge Intenational Education) prerelease (Time zone 2). This was when made when I was seriously getting into python / programming. I have tremendously improved since then in both how I structure programs and my programming styles.

## How to run
On linux type `python3 /path/to/file/Python_IGCSE_PreRelease_2019.py` or `python3 ./Python_IGCSE_PreRelease_2019.py` into the terminal.

## TODO
- [ ] Redo this python program
